## Beginner's Welcome!

This is a great project to contribute to if you'd like experience working on a real-world practical Haskell codebase.
There are a number of issues in the issue tracker, each of which should have enough information to get you started.
If you need more information or would like advice on implementing, feel free to post a comment and I'll be happy to help out.
